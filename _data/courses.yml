  description: "Scientific literature is a foundational aspect of the research landscape but can be challenging to navigate for students. Through a structured format and guided questions, students learn how to critically evaluate information being presented and to lead discussion (each student leads at least one session per semester). The literature is carefully selected to cover a broad range of topics and levels of complexity. Classic papers are paired with recent publications. In addition, students will learn how academic publishing works, the peer review process, reproducibility, and how to navigate the literature to identify papers that are most relevant to them."

This will be followed by structured group discussions, designed to enhance understanding. Students in semester three should also attend, and towards the end of the winter semester they will present the research they intend to pursue in semester four."

  administrator: warnock
  description: "This module examines science and technology within a historical and social context, and how scientific knowledge is transmitted and transformed, or not, into action. Students will explore the interplay between science and society, how scientific advances influence policies, while societal structures, in turn, shape the direction of scientific research. Through case studies and assignments, students will learn how established structures can impede interdisciplinary research and international collaboration. By integrating social science approaches alongside practical scientific training, this module empowers students to navigate and challenge traditional disciplinary boundaries."

  description: "This course introduces the fundamentals of statistical hypothesis testing, with a focus on case studies relevant to Earth system science. We will cover probability theory, parameter estimation and uncertainty, frequentist and Bayesian inference, model adequacy, and discussions around the interpretation and communication of results. Students learn how to formulate and test their own hypotheses and apply this knowledge to reproduce (and potentially improve) published scientific results, gaining an awareness of reproducibility practices.

  description: "In this course students bring together knowledge and skills gained from across the curriculum to develop a project proposal, in the style of a research grant, that will form the basis of their thesis. Through conceptualizing and designing their own project, students will gain experience going from overarching research questions to feasible research objectives. They will learn how to present their research ideas to appeal to a broader scientific audience, i.e., placing emphasis on the bigger scientific picture (emulating the practice of grant writing). Students will be introduced to project management tools and encouraged to develop ambitious but feasible projects. To develop more interdisciplinary projects, students can recruit two or more supervisors, including external experts. "

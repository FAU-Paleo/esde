Please note that for logistic reasons, the deadlines for the applications differ depending on your country of origin. Read on to find out what deadlines apply to you.



### 1. Applicants from <strong style="color:red">slow-visa</strong> countries *(Group 1)*

Getting a visa from countries that do not have a fast visa-access program to Germany can easily take up to **several months**.
Based on our experience, unless we can process your application way before the formal deadline (*15 July 2023*), it is very likely that **you will not make it to Germany by the time the winter semester starts**.

In the next section you can find a list out countries that *have fast access to German visa*. If your country of origin is **not** in the list below, you belong in the **slow-visa** group. The deadline for applications for this group is <strong style="color:red">April 30, 2023</strong>. 

### 2. Applicants from <strong style="color:red">fast-visa</strong> countries *(Group 2)*

Applicants from countries that can get a quick visa have time to apply until <strong style="color:red">July 15, 2023</strong>. These countries include:  

- countries of the EU/EEA
- Albania
- Andorra
- Australia
- Bosnia & Herzegovina
- Brazil
- Canada

- Israel
- Japan
- Macao
- Moldova

- Montenegro
- New Zealand

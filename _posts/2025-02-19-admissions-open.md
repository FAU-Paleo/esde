Please note that for logistic reasons, we strongly encourage people that come from **slow-visa countries to apply as soon as possible** and start the process of getting a visa to Germany.



### 1. Applicants from <strong style="color:red">slow-visa</strong> countries *(Group 1)*

Getting a visa from countries that do not have a fast visa-access program to Germany can easily take up to **several months**.
Based on our experience, unless we can process your application way before the formal deadline (*15 July 2025*), it is very likely that **you will not make it to Germany by the time the winter semester starts**. This might mean that you will not be able to keep up with the progress of your cohort.

In the next section you can find a list out countries that *have fast access to German visa*. If your country of origin is **not** in the list below, you belong in the **slow-visa** group. We urge you to apply before <strong style="color:red">April 30, 2025</strong>. 

### 2. Applicants from <strong style="color:red">fast-visa</strong> countries *(Group 2)*

Applicants from countries that can get a quick visa have time to apply until the final deadline on <strong style="color:red">July 15, 2025</strong>. These countries include:  

- countries of the EU
- Iceland
- Norway
- Switzerland
- UK 
- USA 

If your country of origin is not in this list, please apply as soon as possible.

Please let us know if you are interested in applying to the program, so we can provide assistance! Write us at [pal-master@fau.de](mailto:pal-master@fau.de?subject=Question%20about%20application), and we will answer your questions and help you move forward!

# Admissions are closed, but...

Even though you cannot apply to our program at the moment, there is a couple of things that you can do to increase your chances next year:

- Please stay in tune for updates of our webpage to find out more about us and our program.  
- You can secure a scholarship for your studies, which has to preceed your application. Please check out some options [here]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/admission/financing/#scholarships-and-grants). 
- Let us know if you have any questions! Write us at [pal-master@fau.de](mailto:pal-master@fau.de?subject=Question%20about%20application) if you think we can answer them. 

Admissions will be open again in **February 2026**.

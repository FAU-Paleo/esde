Naturally, our output is much more diverse and these are just the main themes that we follow in our research. You can find out more about research at the [GeoZentrum](https://www.gzn.nat.fau.eu/forschung/arbeitsgruppen/), the [Institute of Geography](https://www.geographie.nat.fau.de/en/forschung/) and at the biology institute at the University of Bayreuth

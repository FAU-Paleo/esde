## Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)

<div class="row">
<div class="large-8 medium-8 columns" markdown="1">
Founded in 1743, [Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg (FAU)](https://www.fau.eu) is a research university primarily based in Erlangen with campuses across the Nuremberg metropolitan area. FAU is consistently ranked highly in both national and international rankings. According to [Reuters Top 100](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/EUROPE-UNIVERSITY-INNOVATION/010091N02HR/index.html), FAU is the most innovative university in Germany, the 2nd in Europe, and the 14th in the world. In the [„Shanghai Ranking“ of Academic Ranking of World Universities, 2025](https://www.shanghairanking.com/institution/university-of-erlangen-nuremberg), FAU belongs to the top 300 universities worldwide.

The courses in the master and the [Faculty of Natural Sciences](https://nat.fau.eu) are in [Erlangen](#the-city-of-erlangen), but thanks to efficient [public transport](https://www.vgn.de/), students can choose from a wide housing offer, from lively downtown Nuremberg to countryside locations outside Erlangen.

The [Faculty of Natural Sciences](https://nat.fau.eu) is organized into five departments. We are part of the Department of Geology and Geography, which is represented by two institutions: the [GeoZentrum Nordbayern](#geozentrum-nordbayern) (focusing on geosciences), and the [The Institute of Geography](#institute-of-geography) (focusing on physical and cultural geography).

<span class="moreee"> About the GeoZentrum as an institution</span>

The GeoZentrum organizes the majority of courses related to the master program. 

The main building of the GeoZentrum has a very central location, in the Gardens of the University Castle (in the [*Schloßgarten*](https://www.google.com/maps/place/GeoCenter+Northern+Bavaria/@49.5971029,11.0034406,1018m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a1f8de1f650649:0x5cf3eaa61a07ee7c!8m2!3d49.5970903!4d11.0056338)). Most geosphere and hydrosphere-related courses take place in this building.

For historic reasons, the [Paleontology (*Lehrstuhl für Paläoumwelt*)](https://www.gzn.nat.fau.eu/palaeontologie/) is somewhat separated physically from the rest of the GeoZentrum, and its buildings are spread out. The main Paleontology building (usually referred to as the *"Pal"*) is technically an old, three-storey villa, about ten minutes of walk away from the GeoZentrum, in  [Loewenichstr. 28](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Loewenichstra%C3%9Fe+28,+91054+Erlangen/@49.5980424,11.0136737,1021m/data=!3m2!1e3!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x47a1f91f303344db:0x64cb18650acc59a2!8m2!3d49.5980425!4d11.0181583). Some parts of the [palaeontology collection](https://sammlung.pal.uni-erlangen.de/GeoZentrum/sam_public_search.php) are also stored in the basement.

Together with the Paleontology our colleagues at the University of Bayreuth, in particular, the [Bayreuth Center of Ecology and Environmental Research](https://www.bayceer.uni-bayreuth.de/bayceer/en/mitarbeiter/bayceer/ag.php) contribute to biosphere-related courses.

## The city of Erlangen

<div class="row b30">
<div class="large-12 columns">
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlangen">Erlangen</a> is an Middle Franconian city located in Bavaria, southern Germany, close to the larger city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuremberg"> Nuremberg (<i>Nürnberg</i>)</a>. Originally the home of the Huguenots, Erlangen is now an international hub for research and technology, thanks to the presence of the university, university hospital, and Siemens. The city itself has lots to offer, including theatre performances, cosy cafés, sporting and leisure activities, and a lively pub scene and night life. The area around the city of Erlangen is famous for its hilly Jurassic landscape with many fossil-collecting localities, hiking trails, cycling routes, caves, castles, climbing routes, and small breweries. The mixture of academia, technology, culture, and natural beauty makes Erlangen and the wider the region the perfect place for creative minds, keen athletes and nature lovers.

Erlangen is very well connected to the rest of Germany and beyond. Nuremberg <a href="https://www.airport-nuernberg.de/english">(NUE)</a> airport is only half an hour outside of the city and the larger airports of Frankfurt and Munich are only short (~2 hour) train rides away. By train or bus, it is easy to reach other cities and natural landscapes, including Munich (~1 hour by train), Berlin (~3 hours by train), and Prague (~4 hours by bus), as well as the <a href= "https://www.fraenkische-schweiz.com/">Franconian Switzerland<i> (Fränkische Schweiz)</i></a> region, and Solnhofen and the Bürgermeister-Müller-Museum (1.5 hours by train).

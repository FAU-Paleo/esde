## Step 2: Online application via [Campo](https://www.campo.fau.de/)


<div class="row">
<div class="medium-8 large-10 columns" markdown="1">
The formal application process starts on the [Campo portal](https://campo.fau.de). Before proceeding with this step, please ensure that you meet the [academic admissions criteria](https://palaeobiology.nat.fau.de/admission/requirements/) and have acquired the required documents (see below).

To help with your application we have prepared a detailed stepwise guide. In this guide, you will see the process divided into two parts: *Part A* describes how to register for a Campo account, and *Part B* describes the full online application process via Campo. Please follow all steps carefully and [email](mailto:pal-master@fau.de?subject=Question%20about%20application) us if you have any queries. At the end of this process, you should receive an email confirming that your application has been submitted.



<div class="row">
<div class="medium-8 large-10 columns" markdown="1">

<div class="panel radius" markdown="1">

Translations of certain documents are necessary if they are not already in English, German or French. The stepwise guide contains further information, and for further details, please see the [checklist prepared by FAU](https://www.fau.de/files/2019/12/Checklist-international.pdf).

##### Required documents:
{:.no_toc}
- **University entrance qualification** (i.e. school leaving certificate), issued by your secondary school if you have completed your secondary level education in Germany. International applicants will follow separate instructions, as outlined in our application guidance document.
- **Transcript of records**, issued by your university, and accompanied by translated version(s) if necessary.
- **Degree certificate** if available, and translated version(s) if necessary. In case that you are in your final year and have not yet completed your Bachelor's, this document can be uploaded once it becomes available to you.
- **Proof of proficiency in English** (if applicable). Please see the step-by-step [application guide](https://palaeobiology.nat.fau.de/downloads/2024_online_application_guide.pdf) for further details.
- **German language exemption document**. As the program is delivered through English and does not require any knowledge of German, we have prepared a simple exemption document, which you will find a link to in the step-by-step [application guide](https://palaeobiology.nat.fau.de/downloads/2024_online_application_guide.pdf).
- **Curriculum Vitae (CV)** (max. 2 pages, in English), outlining your qualifications and experience.
- **Motivation letter** (max. 700 words, in English) outlining your motivations for applying for this program and how it aligns with your career aspirations.

## Step 3: Online interview

Once your application has been processed and you are eligible to be admitted, you will be invited to an interview. All details will be communicated to you via email. Applicants who have completed a Bachelors (BSc) in Geosciences and who have achieved a grade that translates to a German grade 2.5 or higher may not need to participate in an interview.

<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/misc/video_conference.jpg">
</div>

<div class="medium-8 large-8 columns" markdown="1">


Interviews typically take place after applications close in late July or early August. Interviews will take place virtually (via [Zoom](https://zoom.us)) and will be conducted through English. The main purpose of the interview is to assess your knowledge of key principles in geoscience and paleobiology. To aid in your preparation, we will recommend some reading material in your invitation email. During the interview we will also invite you to talk about your academic background, prior experience in paleobiology, and motivation for applying to this program. You will also have the opportunity to ask us any questions about the course and studying in Germany.

Applicants will be notified of the outcome of their application by mid-August. For admitted students, enrolment will begin in September.

If you are coming from a [Group 1]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/admission/now/#1-applicants-from-slow-visa-countries-group-1) country, we advise that you begin your application for a German visa as soon as you have been invited to interview. This is due to some embassies recently experiencing high demand in applications.

### Overview

<div class="row">
<div class="large-7 medium-6 columns" markdown="1">

The <span class="veryhighlight">Earth System Dynamics and Evolution</span> master's program takes place over 2 years and is made up of 4 semesters. During the first 3 semesters (year 1 and half of year 2), students will take [regular courses]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/courses/). The final (4th) semester is dedicated to the [Masters thesis]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/highlights/#master-thesis). These [regular courses]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/courses/) include interdisciplinary core modules, discipline-specific foundational courses and more advanced elective courses, that include advanced data analytical, modelling, laboratory or field courses.

#### Atmosphere

The modules in this theme are designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of atmospheric processes in both contemporary and deep time contexts. Courses cover the physical and chemical properties of the atmosphere, atmospheric dynamics, and the interactions between the atmosphere and other Earth systems. Students will also explore methods for projecting and approaches to reconstructing climate over different scales.

<div class="large-8 medium-12 small-12 columns sphere-para" markdown="1" id="bio-para" style="display:none">
#### Biosphere

The modules in this theme are designed to equip students with a comprehensive understanding of ecological and evolutionary processes, how we analyze and model these processes in deep time, and how we bring together evidence from the fossil, geological, and molecular records.

</div>
<div class="large-8 medium-12 small-12 columns sphere-para" markdown="1" id="hydro-para" style="display:none">
#### Hydro- and Cryosphere

The modules in this theme are designed to enable students to acquire knowledge of the hydrological cycle, including groundwater, water quality and quantity considering natural and anthropogenic processes, and how they interact with atmosphere, biosphere, and geosphere. Through these modules, students gain insights into data collected from the field, analytical and modeling techniques, chemical tools used in research fields related to the hydrosphere, such as hydrology, hydrogeology, hydrogeochemistry, and water resources management and modeling.

</div>

<div class="large-8 medium-12 small-12 columns sphere-para" markdown="1" id="geo-para" style="display:none">
#### Geosphere

The modules in this theme are designed to enable students to acquire knowledge of global cycles and processes across the Earth's surface and interior. Through these modules, students gain insights into data collected from the field, analytical techniques, and chemical tools used in various research fields related to the geosphere, such as geodynamics, mineralogy, geochemistry, sedimentology, geophysics, and tectonics.

</div>

</div>

Students who complete the program will earn a '**MSc. in Earth System Dynamics and Evolution**'. The degree and the acquired knowledge opens up a wide range of potential career paths - primarily in the academic/scientific sector.

### Important details
<div class="row">
<div class="large-7 medium-6 columns" markdown="1">

- Teaching begins in the **Winter Semester (*WiSe*)**, which runs from mid-October until mid-February each year. The **Summer Semester (*SoSe*)** runs from mid-April until the end of June, though some courses might take place outside of these intervals.
- Each semester equates to [30 ECTS](https://education.ec.europa.eu/education-levels/higher-education/inclusive-and-connected-higher-education/european-credit-transfer-and-accumulation-system), with the full masters program making up a total of 120 ECTS.
- The entire program is delivered through **English** by a team of international instructors affiliated with the GeoZentrum Nordbayern (FAU), the Institute of Geography (FAU) and BayCEER (Uni Bayreuth).

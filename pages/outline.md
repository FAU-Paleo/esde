### Overview

<div class="row">
<div class="large-7 medium-6 columns" markdown="1">

Our master's program in Paleobiology takes place over 2 years and is made up of 4 semesters. During the first 3 semesters (year 1 and half of year 2), students will take [regular courses]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/courses/). The final (4th) semester is dedicated to the [Masters thesis]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/highlights/#master-thesis). In addition to the [regular courses]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/courses/), students will take [supplementary courses]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}/courses/#supplementary-courses), which include field excursions to various European destinations and block courses on a range of topics. Students who complete the program will earn a '**MSc in Geosciences (Paleobiology)**'.

### Important details
<div class="row">
<div class="large-7 medium-6 columns" markdown="1">

- Teaching begins in the **Winter Semester (*WiSe*)**, which runs from mid-October until mid-February each year. The **Summer Semester (*SoSe*)** runs from mid-April until the end of June, though some courses might take place outside of these intervals.
- Each semester equates to [30 ECTS](https://education.ec.europa.eu/education-levels/higher-education/inclusive-and-connected-higher-education/european-credit-transfer-and-accumulation-system), with the full masters program making up a total of 120 ECTS.
- The entire program is delivered through **English** by a team of international [instructors]({{site.baseurl }}/instructors/current/).
- The paleobiology masters program is integrated into the [MSc in Earth Sciences (*MSc Geowissenschaften*)](https://www.gzn.nat.fau.eu/study/current-students/masters-degree-in-geoscience/) at [FAU's GeoZentrum Nordbayern]({%link pages/erlangen_and_the_fau.md%}/#friedrich-alexander-universität-erlangen-nürnberg-fau). To meet formal requirements for this program, students choose a major and a minor subject. For paleobiology, this constitutes the major in **Paleobiology-Paleoenvironments** and the minor in **Climate and Earth System**.
- The **Paleobiology-Paleoenvironments major** provides a theoretical framework in macroevolution, ecology, paleoenvironmental reconstruction, and statistical analysis.
- The **Climate and Earth Systems minor** consists of the individual field- and specimen-based projects and provides students with skills such as preparation of funding applications, scientific writing, and communication, as well as environmental and geochemical background for interdisciplinary cooperations.
